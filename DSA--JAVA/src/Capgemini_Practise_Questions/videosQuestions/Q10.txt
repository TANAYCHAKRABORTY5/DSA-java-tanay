Description:

your task here is to implement a java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner. Consider the default visibility of classes, data fields and methods unless menctioned.

Specifications:

class definitions:

class Person:

method definitions:

data fields:

private name: String variable

private age: int variable

method definitions:

Person(String name, int age): constructor

Getter Methods:

getName()

getAge()

Setter Methods:

setName()

setAge()

class StreamImplementation:

method definitions:

sumAge(List<Person> list)

return type:int

visibility: public

printName(List<Person> list):

returntype: List<String>

visibility: public

printAge(List<Person> list):

return type: List<Integer>

visibility: public

Create a Person class which has the following private members.

name String

age int

1. Define parameterized constructor

2.define getter method for all instance variables

3.Define setter methods for all instance varibales

create a StreamImplementation class which performs operations (as per the given requirements) using StreamApi

- Use appropriate Stream Api methods to get the sum of ages above 50. (java.util.Stream has sum() method when used with filter() gives the required result)

for Ex- list.stream().filter(i->i>5) // Get elements greater than 5

- Crate a method printName(List<Person> list) that returns the name of all the persons. (you can use map() and collect(toList() method)

-Create a method printAge(List<Person> list) that returns the age of all the persons. (you can use map() and collect(toList() method)

Implement using Lambda Expressions
