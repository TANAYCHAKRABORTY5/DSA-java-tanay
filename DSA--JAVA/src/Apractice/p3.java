/* jack is always excited about sunday. It is favourite
day, when he gets to play all day. And goes to cycling
with his friends.

So every time when the months starts he
counts the number of sundays he will get to enjoy.
Considering the month can start with any day, be it Sunday
, Mondayâ€¦. Or so on.

Count the number of Sunday jack will get within
n number of days. */
