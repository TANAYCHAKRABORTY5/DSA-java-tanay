4. Harry's Assignment
Description
Harry has recently learned about strings in his programming classes. He decided to create some interesting strings using the basic concepts.
Help Harry!
Your task here is to implement a JAVA code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner.
Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and methods unless mentioned otherwise. All the methods that you are implementing should be non-static.
Specification: I
class definitions:
class StringPlay:
data fields:
int convert
int max;
StringPlay(): Define an empty constructor with publi
class StringMethods:
convertTolnt(StringPlay sp, String str):
visibility: public
return type: int
getMax (StringPlay sp, String str, char ch):
visibility: public
return type: int
Task:

class StringPlay
Implement String Play class according to the above specifications
class String Methods
- Implement the below methods for this class:
int convertTolnt(StringPlay sp. String str): Convert the string str to int, return the int value and assign the value to suitable sp
variable(convert). All the strings will contain only numbers.
Example: str = "123" then resultant is 123.
⚫ int getMax(StringPlay sp, String str. char ch). Return the total number of char ch present in string str and assign the value to sp
variable max and return the same value.
• Example: str = "This is good", ch='o' then resultant value = 2
• Example: str = "doselect Et le", ch='e' then resultant value = 3
Sample Input
StringMethods sm = new StringMethods();
StringPlay sp = new StringPlay();
sm.getMax(sp,"fgfgfgf","g")
sm.convertTolnt(sp, "123")
Sample Output
I
3
123
