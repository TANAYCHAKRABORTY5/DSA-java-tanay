ription

During the festival of Christmas this year, you have made up your mind to finally buy a car, something you have been saving up for.

Considering other specifications of a car like its horsepower and mileage, you have shortlisted some brands and their models. Now you're stuck with making a decision on which one to buy. Your little brother comes to your aid and suggests that you buy something that has a really good top speed.

Implement a Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner. Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and methods unless mentioned.

Specifications:

class definitions:

class Model:

data fields:

modelName: String

carSpeed: int

method definitons:

Model (String modelName, int carSpeed): constructor to initialize the class

visibility: public

Define getter setter methods

visibility: public

toString(): has been implemented for you

return type: String

visibility: public

class Implementation:

method definitions:

getModelName(List<Model> list)

return type: List<String>

visibility: public

getModellnfo(List<Model> list, String model, int speed)

return type: Model

visibility: public

Task:

class Model

-define the String variable modelName

-define the int variable carSpeed

-define a constructor

-implement getter setter

-toString() has been implemented for you as part of code stub)

class Implementation

Implement the below methods for this class using StreamApi

-list<String> getModelName (List<Model> list) returns the name of all the models in the list as List<String>

-Model getModelInfo(List<Model> list, String model, int speed) return the model object with the given model name and speed from the list if present, else return null.

Note:- Implement using streams and lambda expressions

Sample input

List<Model> list = new ArrayList<>();

list.add(new Model("SUV", 500));

list.add(new Model("SEDAN", 800));

list //input for modelName()

list, "SUV", 500 //input for getModelinfo()

Sample output

[SUV,SEDAN]

//Output for getModelName()

100%

[Model[model='SUV', speed=500}] //Output for getModelinfo()
