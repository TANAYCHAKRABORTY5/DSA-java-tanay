If the agent name does not exist then create it with a new String list and add the project.
• Add project into the existing agent project list, if the agent name already exists return "Project assigned
successfully" after performing the above operations
-ArrayList<String> currentPojects(String name):
• Write a code to get the projects list for that particular agent name
• return null if the given name doesn't exist or doesnot have any projects, else return the String list of all the
projects.
-String finishProject(String name, String project):
• Write a code to finish a project
• Remove the project that is assigned to the particular agent from his/her list and return "Project finished
successfully".
• Return a message "Not found" if the project is not present in the list or list is empty
